# Software Carpentry Lesson Materials

## Motivation
I've been a Software/Data Carpentry instructor since 2015, and in that time I've delivered the SWC material in a few different ways. This repository collects in one place the various slides, speaker notes and extra bits and pieces that I've delivered for all these courses.

All of this work derives from the original Software and Data Carpentry lessons, and I'm sharing these materials under the same license as the original Software Carpentry lessons (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details).

**The Carpentries:**
